# Global Airport Reccomendation System.

Want to build your own airport? Out of 19,000 airports listed in the U.S, 14,000 are privately owned. Building an airport isn't very complex and expensive compared to what people normally think. Building an airport can also bring positive impacts to the local community by supplying quit various number of jobs. This is because builders, plumbers, electricians will be needed for the building of the airport. In building airports there are several factors that matters. Altitude is one of the most important factor to think carefully when building an airport. Operating at a high altitude airport does require an additional amount of care. In this project, I will be creating a model that can help my clients what type of airport they should build based on the given features.
